## Bank-Card-Location-Detection-System
Developed and proposed a system for banks that uses GPS to track the location of the bank (ATM, credit, debit) card when requested by its user if misplaced or suspected to be theft, and subsequently notifies the cardholder through the mobile banking app notification, E-mail, and SMS.

• It is the choice of the bank cardholder(s) to request the bank for a card with a GPS tracking chip; only the same users can send requests for their card's location when misplaced or suspected to be theft. 

• To use the 'My Card Location' feature, the users should have a card with a GPS tracking chip.

• If someone misplaces their bank card or suspects theft, they can request the current location of their card through the mobile banking app.

• Notification of the current location of the card will be through mobile banking app notification, mail, and SMS.

• The cardholder can then either find the misplaced card with the help of the card’s detected location or in critical cases where they suspect theft; they can quickly request the concerned authorities or block the card themselves to avoid any monetary loss.
