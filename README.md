# Bank-Card-Location-Detection-System
Developed and proposed a system for banks that uses GPS to track the location of the bank (ATM, credit, debit) card when requested by its user if misplaced or suspected to be theft, and subsequently notifies the cardholder through the mobile banking app notification, E-mail, and SMS.
